# ModularGroup

*ModularGroup.m* is a *Mathematica* package which has been developed in the course of the diploma thesis [Computer Algebra and Analysis: Complex Variables Visualized](http://www.risc.jku.at/publications/download/risc_5011/DiplomaThesisPonweiser.pdf), carried out at the [Research Institute for Symbolic Computation (RISC)](http://www.risc.jku.at) of the *Johannes Kepler University Linz* by Thomas Ponweiser under supervision of Univ.-Prof. Dr. Peter Paule. 

Version 0.1 of this *Mathematica* package has been released [here](http://www.risc.jku.at/research/combinat/software/ModularGroup). 

In this repository, extensions and improvements of *ModularGroup.m* may get available in the near future.
