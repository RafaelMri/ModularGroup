\section{The modular tessellation of the upper halfplane}

Since $\FunSet$ is a fundamental set for the action of $\PSL{\Z}$ on $\EU$, its images under all modular transformations cover the extended upper halfplane $\EU$ -- compare also Remark~\ref{rem_FunSetUniqueElement}. Thus for a point $z \in \EU$ there exists a transformation $A \in \PSL{\Z}$ such that $z \in A\FunSet$. We can effectively determine such a transformation by adopting the algorithm of Theorem~\ref{thm_SL2FunDomAlg}:

\begin{theorem}[The fundamental set algorithm]
Let $z \in \EU$ be a point of the extended upper halfplane and let the fundamental set $\FunSet$ be defined as in (\ref{eqn_PSL2FunSet}). A transformation $A$ satisfying $z \in A \FunSet$ can be found by performing the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set $j := -1$ and $B_0 := 1$.
\item \label{itm_PSL2FunSetAlgLoop}
Increment $j$ by one and set $z_j := B_j z$. If $z_j \in \FunSet$, then goto step \ref{itm_PSL2FunSetAlgDone}.
\item \label{itm_PSL2FunSetAlgEjDef}
Set $e_j := \floor{\Re{z_j} + \reci{2}}$. 
\item \label{itm_PSL2FunSetAlgNext}
If $z_j - e_j \in \FunSet$, set $B_{j+1} := U^{-e_j}B_j$ -- else set $B_{j+1} := TU^{-e_j}B_j$.
\item Continue with step \ref{itm_PSL2FunSetAlgLoop}.
\item \label{itm_PSL2FunSetAlgDone} 
The desired matrix $A$ is given by $A = \inv{B_j}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Note that the above is essentially a reformulation of the algorithm of Theorem~\ref{thm_SL2FunDomAlg} with the following modifications:
\begin{enumerate}[\quad (a)]
\item The algorithm is reformulated for the inhomogeneous case. The numbers $z_j$ from above and the vectors $x_j$ from the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm_SL2FunDomAlg} correspond by $z_j = \pi(x_j)$.
\item \label{itm_PSL2FunDomAlgModNint}
Instead of using the $\nint{}$ function, we use the above definition  for determining the coefficients $e_j$ -- see step \ref{itm_PSL2FunSetAlgEjDef}. This is to ensure that $z_j - e_j \in [-\reci{2}, \reci{2})$ -- otherwise we would have problems with the termination of the algorithm for the case when some $z_j$ lies on the boundary arc $b$ (as defined in Theorem~\ref{thm_PSL2FunSet}).
\item Theorem~\ref{thm_SL2FunDomAlg} yields a final vector $x_n$ such that $w := \pi(x_n) \in \topcl{\mathcal{R}}$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is defined as in (\ref{eqn_PSL2MinRegion}). In order to obtain a point in $\FunSet \subseteq \topcl{\mathcal{R}}$, we need to apply to $w$ possibly $T$ and -- if this point lies on the boundary arc $b$ -- possibly $U^{-1}$. We take this into account by explicitly checking whether the application of $T$ in the last iteration of the algorithm is necessary or not (see step \ref{itm_PSL2FunSetAlgNext}) and by the modification discussed in (\ref{itm_PSL2FunDomAlgModNint}).\qedhere
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

In Figure~\ref{fig_ModularTiling} on the top-left, we see the images of the fundamental region $\FunDom$ and its indisk $\Indisk$ under the transformations of the modular group. Each of these images $A \FunDom$ \resp $A \Indisk$ is labeled by the $T$-$U$ word representation of the corresponding transformation $A \in \PSL{\Z}$. We call this covering of $\EU$ by images of $\FunDom$ the \emph{modular tessellation} of the upper halfplane.

For visualization purposes, the upper halfplane has the obvious disadvantage that we can never see the whole picture. Moreover the true symmetry of the modular tessellation with respect to the transformation $T$ cannot be seen either, but it can be revealed by taking on a different view on the upper halfplane: We have seen in Example~\ref{ex_ModCayleyTransform} that the modified cayley transform $\ModCayley$ maps the upper halfplane to the unit disk. We can therefore use $\ModCayley$ to translate the modular tessellation to the unit disk. This means instead of looking at the regions $A \FunDom$ \resp $A \Indisk$ for all $A \in \SL{\Z}$, we can alternatively depict the regions $\ModCayley A \FunDom$ and the corresponding incircles $\ModCayley A \Indisk$ which is done in the bottom-left picture of Figure~\ref{fig_ModularTiling}. 

For a better understanding of this transformed representation of the modular tessellation, let us identify the drawing area with $\R^2$ rather than with $\C$. Now we note that the point $(0,1)$ corresponds to the point $\infty \in \EU$, the points $(\pm 1, 0)$ relate to $\pm 1 \in \EU$ respectively and the point $(0,-1)$ refers to $0 \in \EU$. The center $(0,0)$ represents the imaginary unit $\ii \in \EU$. In other words, as can be seen in the right column of Figure~\ref{fig_ModularTiling}, $\ModCayley$ bends the real axis to a circle\footnote{In fact, the real axis plus the point $\infty$ can be considered as generalized circle already.}, gluing together its ends at the point $\infty$ and enclosing the upper halfplane in its interior. As we have seen in Example~\ref{ex_ModCayleyTransform}, this continuous transition between the tessellation on the upper halfplane and its image under $\ModCayley$ can be explained by a quarter-turn of the Riemann sphere, compare also Figure~\ref{fig_StereoProjModCayley}.

\begin{remark}
In a more formal context, the bottom-left picture of Figure~\ref{fig_ModularTiling} can also be interpreted in two alternative ways: Firstly, we could consider a different action of $\PSL{\Z}$ on $\EC$, which we may denote as $A \ast z$ for $A \in \PSL{\Z}$ and $z \in \EC$. For its definition we make use of the natural action of the Möbius transformation $\ModCayley A \inv{\ModCayley}$:
\begin{equation*}
A \ast z := (\ModCayley A \inv{\ModCayley}) z.
\end{equation*}
Secondly, we could consider $\EC$ under the natural action of a group $G$ of Möbius transformations which is conjugate to $\PSL{\Z}$:
\begin{equation*}
G := \ModCayley \PSL{\Z} \inv{\ModCayley} = \setdefsz{\Big}{A \in \PSL{\Z[\ii]}}{\htransp{A} = A}.
\end{equation*}
The transformations of $G$ are represented by Hermitian matrices with coefficients in the ring of Gaussian integers $\Z[\ii]$ having determinant 1. Clearly both, the action $\ast$ of $\PSL{\Z}$ as well as the natural action of $G$, leave the unit disk $\ModCayley \mathcal{H}$ invariant. Consequently $\ModCayley \FunDom$ is a fundamental region for both (equivalent) actions on the unit disk. Now the bottom-left picture of Figure~\ref{fig_ModularTiling} can be interpreted as the tessellation induced by either of these two actions with respect to the fundamental region $\ModCayley \FunDom$.
