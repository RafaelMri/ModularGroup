\subsection{Generalized circles}

\index{Generalized!circle}
From the geometric point of view, Möbius transformations have the beautiful property that they preserve generalized circles. \emph{Generalized circles} are either circles (in the usual sense) or lines on the complex plane $\C$. They can also be thought of circles on the Riemann sphere (\ie the extended complex plane $\EC$ projected to the unit sphere $\UnitSphere$, see Remark~\ref{rem_RiemannSphere}), where lines on the complex plane stand in a one-to-one correspondence to circles through the point $\infty$ on the Riemann sphere. In order to give an exact definition, we first make the following considerations:

A circle with center $m \in \C$ and radius $r > 0$ can be described as the set of points $z \in \C$ for which
\begin{equation*}
\abs{z - m} = r.
\end{equation*}
This is obviously equivalent to
\begin{equation*}
\abs{z - m}^2 = (z - m) \conj{(z - m)} = r^2
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_Circle}
z \conj{z} - m \conj{z} - \conj{m} z + m \conj{m} - r^2 = 0.
\end{equation}
The generalization comes into play if we multiply this last equation by a constant $A \in \R$
\begin{equation*}
A z \conj{z} - A m \conj{z} - A \conj{m} z + A m \conj{m} - A r^2 = 0
\end{equation*}
and introduce constants $B$, $C$ and $D$ appropriately such that we can write it in the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_GenCircle}
A z \conj{z} + B \conj{z} + C z + D = 0.
\end{equation}
Note that $D$ is real and $B = \conj{C}$ are complex conjugates. From an equation of form (\ref{eqn_GenCircle}) we can read off the center and radius of the corresponding circle by
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
m &=& -\frac{B}{A}, \IEEEyessubnumber \\
r &=& \sqrt{m \conj{m} - \frac{D}{A}} = \sqrt{\frac{BC - AD}{A^2}}. \IEEEyessubnumber
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
Clearly we can only do so, if $A \ne 0$ and $BC - AD > 0$. 

In the case when $A = 0$, equation (\ref{eqn_GenCircle}) can be written as
\begin{equation*}
\Re{\frac{C}{\abs{C}} z} = -\frac{D}{2 \abs{C}},
\end{equation*}
which defines a line on the complex plane. We see this by considering the simpler equation $\Re{z} = -\frac{D}{2 \abs{C}}$ first (we omit the factor $\frac{C}{\abs{C}}$), which obviously defines a line parallel to the imaginary axis through the real point $-\frac{D}{2 \abs{C}}$. Then we observe that the multiplication with $\frac{C}{\abs{C}}$ just rotates this line clockwise around the origin by an angle which is given by $\arg(C)$.

To conclude our considerations, we note that equation (\ref{eqn_GenCircle}) can also be written in matrix form:
\begin{equation*}
\rvec{\conj{z}}{1} \cdot \mat{A}{B}{C}{D} \cdot \cvec{z}{1} = 0.
\end{equation*}
The matrix in this equation has a negative determinant, because of the condition $BC - AD > 0$ from above. Moreover, it is a Hermitian matrix, a notion which we will shortly recall:
\begin{definition}
\label{dfn_HermitianMatrix}
\index{Hermitian!matrix}
\index{Hermitian!transpose}
\index{Conjugate transpose}
Let $n > 0$ and $M \in \Mat{\C}{n}{n}$. The matrix
\begin{equation*}
\htransp{M} := \transp{\overline{M}}
\end{equation*}
obtained by complex conjugation and transposition of $M$ is called \emph{Hermitian transpose} or \emph{conjugate transpose} of $M$. If $M$ has the property $\htransp{M} = M$, it is called a \emph{Hermitian} matrix.
\end{definition}
Having now the right vocabulary at hand, we can give an exact definition for generalized circles.
\begin{definition}
Let $M = \smallmat{A}{B}{C}{D} \in \Mat{\C}{2}{2}$ be a Hermitian matrix with $\det(M) < 0$. A \emph{generalized circle} is the set of solutions $z \in \C$ to
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_GenCircleMat}
\rvec{\conj{z}}{1} \cdot M \cdot \cvec{z}{1} = 0
\end{equation}
plus eventually the point $\infty$, if and only if $A = 0$, \ie when the generalized circle corresponds to a line on the complex plane.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Since there should be no danger of confusion, we will from now on use the same name for a generalized circle and its corresponding Hermitian matrix (which is uniquely determined up to a real scalar factor).
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
\label{rem_GeneralizedDisk}
\index{Generalized!disk}
One could easily do the same thing as above starting with the equations
\begin{equation*}
\abs{z - m} < r \quad \text{or} \quad  
\abs{z - m} \le r
\end{equation*}
instead of $\abs{z - m} = r$, which naturally leads to the notions of open or closed \emph{generalized disks}, determined by
\begin{equation}
\rvec{\conj{z}}{1} \cdot M \cdot \cvec{z}{1} < 0 \quad \text{or} \quad
\rvec{\conj{z}}{1} \cdot M \cdot \cvec{z}{1} \le 0.
\end{equation}
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm_MoebiusGenCircle}
Let $M \in \Mat{\C}{2}{2}$ be a Hermitian matrix with $\det(M) < 0$ and $P \in \GL{\C}$. The image of the generalized circle $M$ under the Möbius transformation $\phi$ corresponding to the matrix $P \in \GL{\C}$ is the generalized circle  $\htransp{(\inv{P})} \cdot M \cdot \inv{P}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let us write $P = \smallmat{a}{b}{c}{d}$, such that the corresponding Möbius transformation $\phi$ has the form
\begin{equation*}
\phi(z) = \moebius{a}{b}{c}{d}{z}.
\end{equation*}
Now we set $w = \phi(z)$ and show that 
\begin{equation*}
\rvec{\conj{z}}{1} \cdot M \cdot \cvec{z}{1} = 0
\end{equation*}
if and only if
\begin{equation*}
\rvec{\conj{w}}{1} \cdot \htransp{(\inv{P})} \cdot M \cdot \inv{P} \cdot \cvec{w}{1} = 0.
\end{equation*}
But this follows immediately from
\begin{equation*}
P \cdot \cvec{z}{1} = \cvec{a z + b}{c z + d} = (c z + d) \cvec{w}{1}.\qedhere
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}
