\section{The modular group and continued fractions}

For an arbitrary modular transformation $A$, a representation as product of shifts $U^j: z \mapsto z+j$ and inversions $T: z \mapsto -\reci{z}$ can be found by the $T$-$U$ algorithm of Corollary \ref{cor_ModGrpTUAlg}. By writing out this product, for example in the case when $n=2$, we have
\begin{equation*}
A = U^{e_0}T U^{e_1}T U^{e_2}T U^k,
\end{equation*}
or more explicitly
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_ALongConFrac}
A(z) = e_0 - \reci{e_1 - \reci{e_2 - \reci{k + z}}}.
\end{equation}
\index{Continued fraction}
\index{Pringsheim notation}
Here a close relation between modular transformations and continued fractions immediately gets apparent. In this section we will investigate this relation somewhat deeper. 
First we will use Pringsheim's more space-saving notation for continued fractions, namely
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_ConFracNotation}
b_0 + \frac{a_1}{b_1 + \frac{a_2}{b_2 + \frac{a_3}{b_3 + \dots}}} =: 
b_0 + \cfr{a_1}{b_1} + \cfr{a_2}{b_2} + \cfr{a_2}{b_3} + \dots
\end{equation}
In the case when all $a_j = 1$, we adhere to the standard sequence notation for continued fractions:
\begin{equation*}
b_0 + \reci{b_1 + \reci{b_2 + \dots}} =: [b_0,b_1,b_2,\dots].
\end{equation*}
\index{Convergent}
For determining a continued fraction representation for a real number $\alpha$ such that all $a_j = 1$, one usually sets $\alpha_0 := \alpha$ as well as $b_j := \floor{\alpha_j}$ and $\alpha_{j+1} := \reci{\alpha_j - b_j}$ for $j \ge 0$ until some $\alpha_j$ is zero (which is the case if and only if $\alpha \in \Q$). In any way we obtain a finite or infinite sequence of equations 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_ConFracEqnSeq}
\alpha = \alpha_0 = b_0 + \reci{\alpha_1}, \quad
\alpha_1 = b_1 + \reci{\alpha_2}, \quad
\alpha_2 = b_2 + \reci{\alpha_3}, \quad \dots
\end{equation}
giving rise to the continued fraction representation $\alpha = [b_0, b_1, b_2, \dots]$. The rational number $c_n := [b_0,b_1,\dots,b_n]$ obtained by truncating the continued fraction representation after the coefficient $b_n$, is called the $n$-th \emph{convergent} of the continued fraction. If the continued fraction is infinte, \ie $\alpha \in \R \setminus \Q$, then we have $\lim_{n \to \infty} c_n = \alpha$.

\begin{remark}
\label{rem_ConFracKinds}
\index{Continued fraction!regular}
Note that by using the method above, all the coefficients $b_j$ with $j > 0$ are positive. A representation for $\alpha$ of this form is called a \emph{regular continued fraction} -- see also \Lehner{}, §9. 

\index{Continued fraction!semi-regular}
In contrast to that, if we set $b_j := \ceil{\alpha_j}$ for some or all of the indices $j$, then also negative coefficients $b_j$, $j > 0$, will occur and we obtain in this way a so called \emph{semi-regular continued fraction} representation of $\alpha$. This is in strong analogy to Remark~\ref{rem_EuclideanAlgorithmRounding} that within the Euclidean algorithm the quotients $q_j$ can be determined by rounding $r_{j-1} / r_j$ either up- or downward. Note that in \Lehner{}, §36, semi-regular continued fractions are defined such that for all $j > 0$ the coefficients $b_j$ are positive, but allowing for $a_j \in \{\pm 1\}$. However this makes no essential difference. 

\index{Continued fraction!canonical}
If we use the nearest integer function in each step, \ie $b_j := \nint{\alpha_j}$ for all $j$, then we have $\abs{b_j} \ge 2$ for all $j > 0$. If additionally $\alpha \in \Q$, then it can be shown that the resulting continued fraction representation is one of minimal length -- according to \Lehner{}, §39, we call finite continued fractions with this minimality property \emph{canonical continued fractions}.
\end{remark}

We can now reformulate Corollary \ref{cor_ModGrpTUAlg} in order to construct a continued fraction representation of any given modular transformation.

\begin{corollary}
\label{cor_ModTransConFrac}
An arbitrary modular transformation $A(z) = \moebius{a}{b}{c}{d}{z}$ can be written as continued fraction
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_ModTransConFrac}
A(z) = [q_0,q_1,\dots,q_n,(-1)^{n+1}(k+z)]
\end{equation}
where the integers $n$, $q_0,q_1,\dots,q_n$ and $k$ are determined by the algorithm described in Corollary \ref{cor_ModGrpTUAlg}.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
By using the continued fraction representation of $A$ given in (\ref{eqn_ALongConFrac}) and by applying the definition $e_j$ := $(-1)^j q_j$, we see
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCcCcCcCcCcCc}
A(z) &=& e_0 &+& \cfr{-1}{e_1} 
          &+& \cfr{-1}{e_2} 
          &+& \dots 
          &+& \cfr{-1}{e_n} 
          &+& \cfr{-1}{k + z} \nonumber \\
  &=& q_0 &+& \cfr{-1}{-q_1} 
          &+& \cfr{-1}{q_2} 
          &+& \dots 
          &+& \cfr{-1}{(-1)^n q_n} 
          &+& \cfr{-1}{k + z}. \label{eqn_ModTransConFracInterim}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
Now for every odd $j \le n$ we can rewrite 
\begin{equation*}
\cfr{-1}{-q_j} + \cfr{-1}{\dots} \quad \text{to} \quad \cfr{1}{q_j} + \cfr{1}{\dots}.
\end{equation*}
Thus if $n$ is odd, every numerator $-1$ in (\ref{eqn_ModTransConFracInterim}) can be turned into $+1$. In the other case, when $n$ is even, only one negative numerator at the end, $\frac{-1}{k+z}$, remains, but this can easily be rewritten to $\frac{1}{-(k+z)}$. Taking both cases together, we obtain (\ref{eqn_ModTransConFrac}).
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{rem_TUAlgConFrac}
It is worth noting that determining a continued fraction representation for a rational number $p/q \in \Q$ with $p,q \in \Z$ is essentially equivalent to applying the Euclidean algorithm to the integers $p$ and $q$: If we set $(r_{-1}, r_0) := (p,q)$ and substitute in (\ref{eqn_ConFracEqnSeq}) $\alpha_j = r_{j-1}/r_j$ for all $j \ge 0$, we obtain
\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rClCrCl}
\frac{r_{-1}}{r_0} &=& b_0 + \frac{r_1}{r_0} &\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad& 
  r_{-1} &=& b_0 \cdot r_0 + r_1 \\
\frac{r_0}{r_1} &=& b_1 + \frac{r_2}{r_1} &\Leftrightarrow& 
  r_0 &=& b_1 \cdot r_1 + r_2 \\
\frac{r_1}{r_2} &=& b_1 + \frac{r_3}{r_2} &\Leftrightarrow& 
  r_1 &=& b_2 \cdot r_2 + r_3 \\
 &\vdots& & & &\vdots&
\end{IEEEeqnarray*}
In other words, the coefficients $b_j$ of the desired continued fraction representation are nothing else but the quotients of the Euclidean algorithm which we used to denote by $q_j$.

This observation also allows it to see the $T$-$U$ algorithm of Corollary~\ref{cor_ModGrpTUAlg} in a different light: For a given modular transformation $A(z) = \moebius{a}{b}{c}{d}{z}$, by applying the Euclidean algorithm to $a$ and $c$, we effectively determine a continued fraction representation for the rational number $A(\infty) = \frac{a}{c} = [q_0,q_1,\dots,q_n]$. If we set again $e_j := (-1)^j q_j$, it follows that also the modular transformation $P := U^{e_0}T U^{e_1}T\dots U^{e_n}T$ maps $\infty$ to $\frac{a}{c}$. Since the stabilizer of $\infty$ is generated by the transformation $U$, all transformations with this property can be written as $PU^k$ for some $k \in \Z$.
In particular, if we determine the quotients $q_j$ by rounding to the nearest integer, we obtain a \emph{canonical continued fraction}, \ie a continued fraction representation of minimal length -- compare Remark~\ref{rem_ConFracKinds}. Consequently in this case also the product representation returned by the $T$-$U$ algorithm is of minimal length.
\end{remark}

\begin{corollary}
\label{cor_ConFracModTrans}
Given $r \in \EQ$, a transformation $A \in \PSL{\Z}$ satisfying $A(\infty) = r$ can be found by determining a continued fraction representation of $r$, that is $r = [b_0,b_1,\dots,b_n]$, and setting $A := U^{e_0}T U^{e_1}T \dots U^{e_n}T$ where $e_j := (-1)^j b_j$. In particular, the $k$-th convergent $C_k$, $k \le n$, of this continued fraction representation can be written as $C_k = U^{e_0}T U^{e_1}T \dots U^{e_k}T(\infty)$.
\end{corollary}

We have now seen that there is a natural correspondence between rational numbers, continued fractions and the $T$-$U$ word representations of modular transformations. In order to formalize this correspondence, let us denote by $\Words{\Z} := \bigcup_{n \le 0} \Z^n$ the set of finite integer sequences (or words over the alphabet $\Z$). Furthermore we set $\EQ := \Q \cup \{\infty\}$ and define a map $f: \Words{\Z} \to \EQ$ by
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_ConFracEvalMap}
\fundef{f}{\Words{\Z}}{\EQ}{(b_0,b_1,\dots,b_n)}{[b_0,b_1,\dots,b_n].}
\end{equation}
Note that evaluation of continued fractions shall take place in $\EQ$ with the natural conventions for treating infinite quantities, \ie for $a \ne 0$ and $b \ne \infty$ we have
\begin{equation*}
\frac{a}{0} = \infty,\quad \frac{b}{\infty} = 0,\quad b \pm \infty = \infty.
\end{equation*}
Moreover the empty continued fraction shall evaluate to $\infty$, \ie $f(\epsilon) = \infty$, where $\epsilon \in \Words{\Z}$ denotes the empty sequence. We call the sequence $\beta \in \Words{\Z}$ a \emph{continued fraction representation} for $f(\beta) \in \EQ$. %Two sequences $\beta, \gamma \in \Words{\Z}$ are defined to be \emph{equivalent}, in symbols $\beta \sim \gamma$, if and only if $f(\beta) = f(\gamma)$. 

Next we set $\Syms := \{T,U\} \subseteq \PSL{\Z}$ and let $\FreeGrp{\Syms}$ be the free group generated by the symbols $T$ and $U$. Moreover we denote by $\langle U \rangle$ the subgroup of $\FreeGrp{\Syms}$ which is generated by the symbol $U$ and the subgroup of $\PSL{\Z}$ generated by the transformation $U$. We now consider left cosets of $\langle U \rangle$ in  $\FreeGrp{\Syms}$ and $\PSL{\Z}$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\FreeGrp{\Syms} / \langle U \rangle &:=& \setdef{\sigma \langle U \rangle}{\sigma \in \FreeGrp{\Syms}},\\
\PSL{\Z} / \langle U \rangle &:=& \setdef{A \langle U \rangle}{A \in \PSL{\Z}}.
\end{eqnarray*}
It is important to note these are \emph{not} factor groups, as $\langle U \rangle$ is not a normal subgroup of $\PSL{\Z}$ or $\FreeGrp{\Syms}$. In particular, neither $\PSL{\Z} / \langle U \rangle$ nor $\FreeGrp{\Syms} / \langle U \rangle$ carry a ``natural'' group structure -- we will regard them just as sets. 

We now have defined all domains needed for writing $f : \Words{\Z} \to \EQ$ as composition of three other functions, namely $f = g_3 \circ g_2 \circ g_1$, where
\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCcCc}
g_1 &:& \Words{\Z} &\to& \FreeGrp{\Syms} / \langle U \rangle, \\
g_2 &:& \FreeGrp{\Syms} / \langle U \rangle &\to& \PSL{\Z} / \langle U \rangle, \\
g_3 &:& \PSL{\Z} / \langle U \rangle &\to& \EQ.
\end{IEEEeqnarray*}
Let us first turn to the definition of $g_1$, which maps a continued fraction representation to a left coset of a certain $T$-$U$ group word.
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_MapConFracToPath}
\fundef{g_1}{\Words{\Z}}{\FreeGrp{\Syms} / \langle U \rangle}{(b_0,b_2,\dots,b_n)}{U^{e_0}T U^{e_1}T \dots U^{e_n}T \langle U \rangle} \quad \text{where } e_j := (-1)^j b_j.
%\fundef{g_1}{\Words{\Z}}{\FreeGrp{\Syms} / \langle U \rangle}{(b_0,b_2,\dots,b_n)}{\left( \prod_{j=0}^n (U^{e_j}T) \right) \langle U \rangle} \quad \text{where } e_j := (-1)^j b_j.
\end{equation}
Note that in the case of the empty sequence $\epsilon \in \Words{\Z}$ we have $g_1(\epsilon) = \langle U \rangle$.

In order to define $g_2$, let $\phi: \Sigma \to \PSL{\Z}$ be the canonical embedding, \ie $\phi(T) = T$ and $\phi(U) = U$. Let $\overline{\phi}$ be the unique extension of $\phi$ to a homomorphism $\FreeGrp{\Syms} \to \PSL{\Z}$, according to Theorem~\ref{thm_FreeGrpUniqueHom}. Note that $\overline{\phi}$ is just the map which evaluates $T$-$U$ group words to concrete elements of $\PSL{\Z}$ in the obvious way. The function $g_2$ now takes  a left coset in $\FreeGrp{\Syms}$ to a left coset in $\PSL{\Z}$ by
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_MapPathToCoset}
\fundef{g_2}{\FreeGrp{\Syms} / \langle U \rangle}{\PSL{\Z} / \langle U \rangle}{\sigma \langle U \rangle}{\overline{\phi}(\sigma) \langle U \rangle.}
\end{equation}
Last but not least we define $g_3$ as the map which evaluates the transformations of a left coset $A \langle U \rangle \in \PSL{\Z} / \langle U \rangle$ at the point $\infty$. Note that the result is the same for all transformations within one coset because $\langle U \rangle$ is exactly the stabilizer of $\infty$, \ie $\langle U \rangle = \setdef{B \in \PSL{\Z}}{B(\infty) = \infty}$. This allows us to define
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_MapCosetToEQ}
\fundef{g_3}{\PSL{\Z} / \langle U \rangle}{\EQ}{A \langle U \rangle}{A(\infty).}
\end{equation}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem_ConFracMapEquality}
The maps $g_1$, $g_2$, $g_3$ and $f$, defined as above, satisfy
\begin{equation*}
f = g_3 \circ g_2 \circ g_1.
\end{equation*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
It follows from Corollary~\ref{cor_ConFracModTrans} that the composed map $g_2 \circ g_1: \Words{\Z} \to \PSL{\Z} / \langle U \rangle$ takes a continued fraction representation $(b_0,b_1,\dots,b_n)$ to a left coset $A \langle U \rangle$, such that $g_3(A \langle U \rangle) = A(\infty) = [b_0,b_1,\dots,b_n]$. Therefore we have indeed $f = g_3 \circ g_2 \circ g_1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem_MapConFracToPathInjective}
The map $g_1$ defined in (\ref{eqn_MapConFracToPath}) is injective. Its image $g_1(\Words{\Z})$ consists precisely of those cosets $\sigma \langle U \rangle \in \FreeGrp{\Syms} / \langle U \rangle$, where the $T$-$U$ group word $\sigma$ is such that:
\begin{enumerate}[\quad(i)]
\item \label{itm_NotContainsTInv}
The reduced form of $\sigma$ never contains the symbol $\inv{T}$.
\item \label{itm_RightmostIsT}
If the reduced form of $\sigma$ is not empty, its rightmost symbol is $T$.
\end{enumerate}
In particular there is a one-to-one correspondence between all continued fraction representations and $T$-$U$ group words of this form. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The fact that $g_1$ is injective is obvious. It is also clear that the word
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_ConFracTUWord}
U^{e_0}T U^{e_1}T \dots U^{e_n} T
\end{equation}
with $n \ge 0$, $e_j \in \Z$ occurring in the definition of $g_1$ already is in  reduced form and satisfies the conditions (\ref{itm_NotContainsTInv}) and (\ref{itm_RightmostIsT}). Conversely, every reduced word $w$ satisfying (\ref{itm_NotContainsTInv}) and (\ref{itm_RightmostIsT}) has necessarily the form
\begin{equation*}
w = U^{k_1} T^{\ell_1} U^{k_2} T^{\ell_2} \dots U^{k_m} T^{\ell_m},
\end{equation*}
with $m >= 0$, $k_j \in \Z$ and $\ell_j \ge 1$. Because for $k \ge 1$, $T^k$ and $(TU^0)^{k-1}T$ are \emph{identical} as words, we can for sure notate $w$ alternatively in the form (\ref{eqn_ConFracTUWord}).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem_MapCosetToEQBijective}
The map $g_3$ defined in (\ref{eqn_MapCosetToEQ}) is bijective. In particular there is a one-to-one correspondence between the left cosets of $\langle U \rangle$ in $\PSL{\Z}$ and the extended rational numbers $\EQ$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
If $g_3(A \langle U \rangle) = g_3(B \langle U \rangle)$, then $A(\infty) = B (\infty)$. This is equivalent to $\inv{B}A \in \langle U \rangle$ or $A \langle U \rangle = B \langle U \rangle$. Therefore $g_3$ is injective. Since $f = g_3 \circ g_2 \circ g_1$ is surjective, the same must be true for $g_3$.
\end{proof}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/ford-disks}
\caption{The modular tessellation under the modified Cayley transform $\ModCayley$. The Ford disk $\Forddisk_\infty$ (light gray, labeled with ``$\infty$'') encloses precisely the indisks $B\Indisk$, $B \in \langle U \rangle$, in its interior. It can thus be considered as representative for the subgroup $\langle U \rangle$ in $\PSL{\Z}$. The images of $\Forddisk_\infty$ under the modular group are all Ford disks $\Forddisk_r$ with $r \in \EQ$. For $A \in \PSL{\Z}$, we have $A\Forddisk_\infty = \Forddisk_r$ exactly when $A(\infty) = r$. Therefore $\Forddisk_r$ corresponds directly to both, the  number $r$ (the point, where $\Forddisk_r$ touches the extended real axis) and the left coset $A\langle U \rangle$ ($\Forddisk_r$ encloses precisely the indisks $B\Indisk$, $B \in A \langle U \rangle$).}
\label{fig_FordDisks}
\end{figure}
Looking at the modular tessellation, Figure~\ref{fig_ModularTiling}, we see that the images of the indisk $\Indisk$ of the fundamental region $\FunDom$ 
have a natural one-to-one correspondence to modular transformations, \ie the disk $A\Indisk$ can be considered as a graphical representative for the modular transformation $A$. The question arises, if there is such a visual and clear representation also for left cosets of $\langle U \rangle$ in $\PSL{\Z}$. Indeed, we can see in Figure~\ref{fig_FordDisks} -- depicting the modular tessellation under the modified Cayley transform $\ModCayley$ -- that the disks $U^k\Indisk$, $k \in \Z$ form a ``generalized ring'' which asymptotically approaches the point $\infty$. We can enclose this ring in a generalized disk -- in Figure~\ref{fig_FordDisks}, this enclosing disk is shown in light gray and is labeled with ``$\infty$''.
\begin{definition}
\label{dfn_FordDisk}
\index{Ford disk}
The unique (open) g-disk $\Forddisk_\infty$ containing all the disks $U^k\Indisk$, $k \in \Z$, in its interior and being tangent to each of them is called the \emph{Ford disk at $\infty$}. It contains all points $z \in \C$ with $\Im{z} > 1$. Its defining matrix is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_FordDisk}
\Forddisk_\infty = \mat{0}{-\ii}{\ii}{2}.
\end{equation}
For a modular transformation $A = \smallmat{a}{b}{c}{d} \in \PSL{\Z}$, the image of $\Forddisk_\infty$ under $A$ is called the \emph{Ford disk at $\frac{a}{c}$}, $\Forddisk_{\frac{a}{c}} := A\Forddisk_\infty$.
\end{definition}

The above definition as well as the bijective correspondence between left cosets of $\langle U \rangle$ in $\PSL{\Z}$ and the extended rational numbers $\EQ$ (Lemma~\ref{lem_MapCosetToEQBijective}) can now be explained in view of Figure~\ref{fig_FordDisks}: We can see that every Ford disk $\Forddisk_r$ (the light gray disks, each of them labeled with the corresponding number $r \in \EQ$), ``touches'' the extended real axis $\R_\infty := \R \cup \{\infty\}$ (appearing as unit circle under the modified Cayley transform) exactly in the point $r$, that is
\begin{equation*}
\topcl{\Forddisk_r} \cap \R_\infty = \{r\} \quad \text{for all } r \in \EQ.
\end{equation*}
For the seeing the relation of Ford disks to left costets of $\langle U \rangle$ in $\PSL{\Z}$, first observe that the Ford disk $\Forddisk_\infty$ encloses precisely all indisks $B \Indisk$, $B \in \langle U \rangle$. In this sense, we can consider $\Forddisk_\infty$ as a graphical representative for the subgroup $\langle U \rangle$ of $\PSL{\Z}$. Clearly every Ford disk $\Forddisk_r$, $r \in \EQ$, is the image of $\Forddisk_\infty$ under some transformation $A \in \PSL{\Z}$, \ie $A\Forddisk_\infty = \Forddisk_r$, which is the case if and only if $A(\infty) = r$. Consequently $\Forddisk_r$ encloses all indisks $B\Indisk$, $B \in A \langle U \rangle$ and thus can be considered as graphical representative for the coset $A \langle U \rangle$.

Also the statement of Lemma~\ref{lem_MapConFracToPathInjective}, the one-to-one correspondence between continued fraction representations and $T$-$U$ words of the form (\ref{eqn_ConFracTUWord}), has a nice visual interpretation, as we will illustrate in the following example.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/cont-frac-pi}
\caption{$\pi = \frac{355}{113}$ -- well, almost.}
\label{fig_ConFracPi}
\end{figure}
\begin{example}
\label{ex_ConFracPi}
Consider the (semi-regular) continued fraction expansion of the irrational number $\pi$, obtained by using the nearest integer function for rounding the $\alpha_j$ -- compare Remark~\ref{rem_ConFracKinds}. The first few coefficients of this continued fraction are given by
\begin{equation*}
\pi = [3, 7, 16, -294, 3, -4, 5, -15, -3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, -85, -3, 2, 15, 3, 14,\dots]
\end{equation*}
More coefficients can be found by looking up the sequence A133593 at the \emph{On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS)}\footnote{https://oeis.org}. By Corollary~\ref{cor_ConFracModTrans}, the convergents of this continued fraction give rise to a sequence of Modular transformations:
\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCcCl}
\lbrack 3 \rbrack &=& 3
  &=& U^3 T (\infty),\\
\lbrack 3,7 \rbrack &=& \frac{22}{7} 
  &=& U^3 T U^{-7} T (\infty),\\
\lbrack 3,7,16 \rbrack &=& \frac{355}{113}
  &=& U^3 T U^{-7} T U^{16} T (\infty),\\
\lbrack 3,7,16,-294 \rbrack &=& \frac{104348}{33215} 
  &=& U^3 T U^{-7} T U^{16} T U^{294} T (\infty),\\
&\vdots& &\vdots&
\end{IEEEeqnarray*}
The $T$-$U$ words occurring in this sequence can now be interpreted as ``path'' through the set of indisks $A\Indisk$, $A \in \PSL{\Z}$ as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Start with the Ford disk $\Forddisk_\infty$. Label each indisk $U^k\Indisk$ (contained in $\Forddisk_\infty$) with the corresponding integer $k \in \Z$. The Ford disk $U^3 T \Forddisk_\infty = \Forddisk_3$, corresponding to the convergent $c_0 = 3$, can be approached by starting at the indisk $\Indisk$ (carrying the label 0), going 3 steps right to the indisk with label 3, $U^3 \Indisk$ (marked red in the first row of Figure~\ref{fig_ConFracPi}) and finally applying $T$, that is going from there to the tangent indisk $U^3 T \Indisk$, lying within the Ford disk $\Forddisk_3$.
\item For convenience, set $A_1 := U^3 T$. Within the Ford disk $\Forddisk_3$, label each indisk $A_1 U^k \Indisk$ with the \emph{negated}\footnote{The negation of the sign comes from the fact that we want the indisk labels to correspond to the coefficients $b_j$ of the continued fraction rather than to the exponents $e_j = (-1)^j b_j$ of the $T$-$U$ word.} integer $-k$. Go from indisk $A_1 \Indisk$ (labeled 0) seven steps to the indisk with label 7, $A_1 U^{-7}\Indisk$ -- see second row of Figure~\ref{fig_ConFracPi}. Applying $T$ again takes us to the indisk $A_1 U^{-7} T \Indisk$ within the Ford disk corresponding to the next convergent of the continued fraction: $\Forddisk_{c_1}$, $c_1 = \frac{22}{7}$.
\item Set $A_2 := U^3 T U^{-7} T$. As above, label all indisks $A_2 U^k \Indisk$ within $\Forddisk_{c_1}$ with $k$ and go from $A_2 \Indisk$ with label 0 sixteen steps to $A_2 U^{16} \Indisk$ with label 16 (Figure~\ref{fig_ConFracPi}, 3rd row) and from there to $A_2 U^{16} T \Indisk$, lying within $\Forddisk_{c_2}$, $c_2 = \frac{355}{113}$.

\dots
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

Without explicating further steps of the above example, we can easily imagine how this generalizes to different continued fraction representations of arbitrary real numbers: Given a continued fraction $\alpha = [b_0,b_1,\dots]$, we start with the indisk $\Indisk^{(0)} := \Indisk$ contained in the Ford disk $\Forddisk^{(0)} := \Forddisk_\infty$. For every $j \ge 0$, we label the indisks contained in $\Forddisk^{(j)}$ with successive integers in counter-clockwise direction (if $j$ is even) or in clockwise direction (if $j$ is odd) in such a way that the disk $\Indisk^{(j)}$ carries the label 0. Now we choose $\Indisk^{(j+1)}$ as the unique indisk which is exterior to $\Forddisk^{(j)}$ and tangent to the disk with label $b_j$ (within $\Forddisk^{(j)}$). Moreover we choose as $\Forddisk^{(j+1)}$ the unique Ford disk containing $\Indisk^{(j+1)}$. 

\index{Indisk!path}
Considering also ``intermediate'' indisks (those with labels between 0 and $b_j$ within $\Forddisk^{(j)}$), we describe in this way an \emph{indisk-path}, or in other words a chain of successively tangent disks, through the set of all indisks $A\Indisk$, $A \in \PSL{\Z}$. Such a path always starts at $\Indisk$ and ends at some $U^{e_0}T U^{e_1}T \dots U^{e_n}T\Indisk$, appending exactly one symbol $U$, $\inv{U}$ or $T$ to the previous group word when moving one step forward along the path. Obviously these paths can be considered as a visual representation of $T$-$U$ words of the form (\ref{eqn_ConFracTUWord}) and we can draw the following conclusions:
\begin{itemize}
\item All different paths starting at $\Indisk$ and ending within a given Ford disk $\Forddisk_r$ give rise to different continued fraction representations of the same rational number $r \in \EQ$. In particular continued fraction representations are not unique in any way (unless we impose certain conditions on its coefficients $b_j$, as for example regularity -- compare \Lehner{}, §9).
\end{itemize}
