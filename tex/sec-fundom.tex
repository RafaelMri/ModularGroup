\section{Fundamental regions}

We have seen in Remark~\ref{rem_NatureMoebius} that considering Möbius transformations as meromorphic functions $\EC \to \EC$ very naturally induces a group action of $\PGL{\C}$ on $\EC$. Clearly this group action is also given for any subgroup of $\PGL{\C}$ and in particular for the modular group: For $A = \smallmat{a}{b}{c}{d} \in \PSL{\Z}$ the group action is
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_ModGrpAction}
Az := \moebius{a}{b}{c}{d}{z}.
\end{equation}

We are now interested in subsets of $\EC$ which contain exactly on point $z_0$ of each orbit $[z]_\sim \in \EC/\sim$:

\begin{definition}[Fundamental set]
\label{dfn_FundamentalSet}
\index{Fundamental!set}
Let $G$ be a group acting on the set $\mathcal{S}$. Denote equivalence of points in $\mathcal{S}$ under $G$ by $\sim$, as in (\ref{eqn_GroupActionEquivalence}). A subset $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{S}$ is called a \emph{fundamental set} with respect to the group action of $G$ on $\mathcal{S}$, if $\mathcal{F}$ contains exactly one point from each orbit, \ie the map $\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{S}/\sim$, $x \mapsto [x]_\sim$ is bijective.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Fundamental sets always exist, but they are not unique in any way. If $\mathcal{F}$ is a fundamental set, then for every subset $X \subseteq \mathcal{F}$ and for every $g \in G$, also the set $(\mathcal{F} \setminus X) \cup gX$ is fundamental.
\end{remark}

If -- like in the case of $\EC$ -- the set $\mathcal{S}$ comes together with a topology defined on it, it is often advantageous to use a concept slightly different to fundamental sets:

\begin{definition}[Fundamental region]
Let $G$ be a group acting on a set $\mathcal{S}$ which is (a subset of) a topological space. A nonempty open subset $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{S}$ is called \emph{fundamental region} with respect to the group action of $G$ on $\mathcal{S}$, if it contains no distinct points equivalent under $G$ and if the neighborhood of every boundary point of $\mathcal{F}$ contains a point of $\mathcal{S} \setminus \mathcal{F}$, which is equivalent to a point of $\mathcal{F}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The relation of fundamental sets and fundamental regions is the following: If $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{S}$ is a fundamental region, then its topological closure $\overline{\mathcal{F}}$ contains a fundamental set $\mathcal{F}^\ast$:
\begin{equation*}\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{F}^\ast \subseteq \overline{\mathcal{F}}.
\end{equation*}
In other words, a fundamental set $\mathcal{F}^\ast$ can always be obtained from a fundamental region $\mathcal{F}$ by adjoining certain boundary points to $\mathcal{F}$.

\index{Discontinuity}
However, a fundamental region must not always exist: Consider the group of translations $z \mapsto z + \alpha$, $\alpha \in \R$, acting on the complex plane $\C$. No matter how we arrange a fundamental set $\mathcal{F}^\ast$, take for example the imaginary axis $\Re{z} = 0$, the interior of $\mathcal{F}^\ast$ will always be empty and thus we cannot find a fundamental region. In fact, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a fundamental region is that the group action is \emph{discontinuous} on $\mathcal{S}$, \ie for every $x \in \mathcal{S}$, the orbit $Gx$ must have no accumulation point in $\mathcal{S}$ -- see \Lehner{}, Chapter IV, 1B.

Note that in \Schoeneberg{}, the term ``fundamental region'' is used for any set $X$ containing a fundamental set $\mathcal{F}^\ast$ plus some or all of its (remaining) boundary points. We prefer the above definition for being more close to the commonly used meaning of ``region'', \ie a topologically connected and open set. However, we emphasize that a fundamental region does not need to be topologically connected. 
\end{remark}

The goal of this section is to identify fundamental regions and fundamental sets for the action of the modular group on $\EC$. For this purpose it is instructive to first consider homogeneous modular transformations and their natural action on $\C^2$.
