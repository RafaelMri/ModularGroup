\section{Fundamental sets and regions}

We have seen in Remark~\ref{rem_NatureMoebius} that considering Möbius transformations as meromorphic functions $\EC \to \EC$ very naturally induces a group action of $\PGL{\C}$ on $\EC$. Clearly this group action is also given for any subgroup of $\PGL{\C}$ and in particular for the modular group: For $A = \smallmat{a}{b}{c}{d} \in \PSL{\Z}$ the group action is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_ModGrpAction}
Az := \moebius{a}{b}{c}{d}{z}.
\end{equation}

As usual we call two points $z, w \in \EC$ \emph{equivalent}, in symbols $z \sim w$, if there is a transformation $A \in \PSL{\Z}$ such that $Az = w$. We are now interested in subsets of $\EC$ containing exactly one point from each equivalence class of the relation $\sim$:

\begin{definition}[Fundamental set]
\label{dfn_FundamentalSet}
\index{Fundamental!set}
Let $G$ be a group acting on the set $\mathcal{S}$. Denote equivalence of points in $\mathcal{S}$ under $G$ by $\sim$, as in (\ref{eqn_GroupActionEquivalence}). A subset $\FunSet \subseteq \mathcal{S}$ is called a \emph{fundamental set} with respect to the group action of $G$ on $\mathcal{S}$, if $\FunSet$ contains exactly one point from each orbit $Gx = [x]_\sim$, \ie the map $\FunSet \to \mathcal{S}/\sim$, $x \mapsto [x]_\sim$ is bijective.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Fundamental sets always exist, but they are not unique in any way. If $\FunSet$ is a fundamental set, then for every subset $X \subseteq \FunSet$ and for every $g \in G$, also the set $(\FunSet \setminus X) \cup gX$ is fundamental.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
\label{rem_FunSetUniqueElement}
If $\FunSet$ is a fundamental set for the group action of $G$ on $\mathcal{S}$, then by definition for every $x \in \mathcal{S}$ there is a $g \in G$ such that $gx \in \FunSet$. Clearly this element $g$ is unique if and only if the stabilizer $\Stabilizer{G}{gx} = \setdef{h \in G}{hgx = gx}$ is trivial ($\Stabilizer{G}{gx}$ contains just the identity element). Since the groups $\Stabilizer{G}{gx}$ and $\Stabilizer{G}{x} = \setdef{h \in G}{hx = x}$ are conjugate, \ie
\begin{equation*}
\Stabilizer{G}{x} = \inv{g} \cdot \Stabilizer{G}{gx} \cdot g,
\end{equation*}
we conclude that the element $g \in G$ with $gx \in \FunSet$ is unique if and only if the stabilizer $\Stabilizer{G}{x}$ is trivial. Clearly $gx \in \FunSet$ is equivalent to $x \in \inv{g}\FunSet$, which allows us to reformulate the above fact the following way: The images of the fundamental set $\FunSet$ under the group action of $G$ cover the whole set $\mathcal{S}$, that is
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{S} = \bigcup_{g \in G} g\FunSet.
\end{equation*}
A point $x \in \mathcal{S}$ is covered once, \ie there is a unique $g \in G$ with $x \in g\FunSet$, if and only if $\Stabilizer{G}{x}$ is trivial.
\end{remark}

If -- like in the case of $\EC$ -- the set $\mathcal{S}$ comes together with a topology defined on it, it is often advantageous to use a concept slightly different to fundamental sets:

\begin{definition}[Fundamental region]
\label{dfn_FunDom}
\index{Fundamental!region}
Let $G$ be a group acting on a set $\mathcal{S}$ which is (a subset of) a topological space. A nonempty open subset $\FunDom \subseteq \mathcal{S}$ is called \emph{fundamental region} with respect to the group action of $G$ on $\mathcal{S}$, if it contains no distinct points equivalent under $G$ and if the neighborhood of every boundary point of $\FunDom$ contains a point of $\mathcal{S} \setminus \FunDom$ which is equivalent to a point within $\FunDom$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The relation between fundamental sets and fundamental regions is the following: If $\FunDom \subseteq \mathcal{S}$ is a fundamental region and if the images under $G$ of its topological closure $\topcl{\FunDom}$ cover the whole set $\mathcal{S}$, \ie 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{S} = \bigcup_{g \in G} \topcl{\FunDom},
\end{equation*}
then a fundamental set $\FunSet$ can always be obtained from $\FunDom$ by adjoining certain boundary points of $\FunDom$ and we have $\FunDom \subseteq \FunSet \subseteq \topcl{\FunDom}$.

\index{Discontinuity}
However, a fundamental region must not always exist: Consider the group of translations $z \mapsto z + \alpha$, $\alpha \in \R$, acting on the complex plane $\C$. No matter how we arrange a fundamental set $\FunSet$, take for example the imaginary axis $\Re{z} = 0$, the interior of $\FunSet$ will always be empty and thus cannot be a fundamental region. In fact, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a fundamental region is that the group action is \emph{discontinuous} on $\mathcal{S}$, \ie there exists and \emph{ordinary} point $x \in \mathcal{S}$, meaning that there is no sequence of the form $(g_n y)_{n \ge 0}$ with distinct $g_n \in G$ and arbitrary $y \in \mathcal{S}$ which converges to $x$ -- see \Lehner{}, Chapter IV, 1B.

Note that in \Schoeneberg{}, the term ``fundamental region'' is used for any set $X$ containing a fundamental set $\FunSet$ plus some or all of its (remaining) boundary points. We prefer the above definition for being more close to the commonly used meaning of ``region'', \ie a topologically connected and open set. However, we emphasize that according to our definition a fundamental region does not need to be topologically connected. 
\end{remark}

The goal of the remainder of this section is to identify fundamental regions and fundamental sets for the action of the modular group on $\EC$. For this purpose it is instructive to first consider homogeneous modular transformations and their natural action on $\C^2$.
