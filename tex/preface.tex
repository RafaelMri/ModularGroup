\chapter*{Preface}

The centerpiece of the present diploma thesis, \emph{Computer Algebra and Analysis: Complex Variables Visualized}, is the modular group. The modular group plays an important role in many areas of mathematics, as for example in number theory due to its connection with partition numbers or continued fractions.

This thesis is structured in three parts. In Chapter 1, we introduce basic notions and definitions which are fundamental for the rest of this work. Firstly, we recapitulate the most important basic concepts of group theory. Moreover, we introduce \emph{Möbius transformations} and study their connection to \emph{stereographic projection} in detail. Finally, we define the concept of \emph{generalized circles} and \emph{generalized disks}, using an elegant characterization in terms of Hermitian matrices which turns out to be particularly advantageous in interaction with Möbius transformations. 

Chapter 2 is devoted to the study of the modular group from an algebraic and geometric point of view. Two different and independent algorithms, the $T$-$U$ algorithm and the $T$-$R$ algorithm, are presented which both yield group word representations for arbitrary modular transformations in terms of the transformations $T : z \mapsto \reci{z}$, $U : z \mapsto z+1$ and $R : z \mapsto \reci{z+1}$. Geometric considerations come into play when introducing \emph{fundamental regions} for the action of the modular group on the extended complex plane. A canonical fundamental region is derived which gives rise to the \emph{modular tessellation of the upper-half plane}. Lastly, the basic concepts of 2-dimensional \emph{hyperbolic geometry} are introduced in order to present an alternative and more general method finding fundamental regions. This method gives rise to so-called \emph{normal polygons} and works as well for subgroups of the modular group.

Finally, Chapter 3 has a clear emphasis on visualization. Firstly, \emph{generalized matrix powers} are introduced as device for visualization of continuous transitions between given sets and their Möbius-transformed images. Secondly, the relation between the modular transformations, \emph{Ford circles} and \emph{continued fractions} is studied in detail and visually explained using the continued fraction expansion of the irrational number $\pi$ as an example. Lastly, documenting the important role of the modular group within complex analysis, the most basic results from the theory of \emph{modular functions} are summarized. Using an adequate color coding, graphs of certain selected modular functions are depicted whose inherent visual aesthetics and symmetry reflects well the beauty of this theory.
