\subsection{Stereographic projection}

This section is about the great work of Douglas Arnold and Jonathan Rogness, ``Möbius transformations revealed'' \cite{arnold2008mobius}, in which the authors give a characterization of Möbius transformations in terms of stereographic projections and rigid motions of spheres 3D-space.
