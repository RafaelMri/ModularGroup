\subsection{Stereographic projection}

This section is about the great work of Douglas Arnold and Jonathan Rogness, ``Möbius transformations revealed'' \cite{arnold2008mobius}, in which the authors give a characterization of Möbius transformations in terms of stereographic projections and rigid motions of spheres 3D-space.

In order to introduce stereographic projection, we first have to embed $\C$ into $\R^3$. We do by using the map $\iota: \C \to \R^3,\ z \mapsto \left(\Re{z}, \Im{z}, 0\right)$, which means that we identify the complex plane with the plane $x_3 = 0$. Next we have to define admissible spheres:

\begin{definition}
A \emph{sphere} with center $c \in \R^3$ and radius $r > 0$ is the set $S := \setdef{x \in \R^3}{\eucnorm{x - c} = r}$. Its \emph{north-pole} is the unique point $n \in S$ with maximal $x_3$-coordinate. A sphere whose north pole lies in the upper half-space $H := \setdef{x \in \R^3}{x_3 > 0}$ is called an \emph{admissible sphere}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{dfn_StereoProject}
Let $S$ be an admissible sphere and $n \in S$ be its north pole. The \emph{stereographic projection} $P_S: \RS \to S$ assigns each $z \in \RS$ a corresponding point $x \in S$ the following way: If $z \ne \infty$, then the  unique line joining $\iota(z)$ with $n$ intersects $S$ in exactly one other point $x \ne n$, which is defined to be the image of $z$, $P_S(z) := x$ and $P_S(\infty) := n$. 
\end{definition}

Note, that the stereographic projection maps $\RS$ bijectively to every admissible sphere $S \subseteq \R^3$.

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm_MoebiusRevealed}
A function $\phi : \RS \to \RS$ is a Möbius transformation, if an only if it can be obtained by stereographic projection of $\RS$ to an admissible sphere $S \subseteq \R^3$, followed by a \emph{rigid motion}\footnote{Rigid motions are affine transformations of $\R^3$ which are only composed of rotations and translations.} T of $\R^3$ which maps $S$ to another admissible sphere $TS$, followed by inverse stereographic projection from $TS$ back to $\RS$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_MoebiusRevealedForm}
\phi = P_{TS}^{-1} \circ T \circ P_S.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of proof]
We will only show that each Möbius transformation $\phi$ can be realized in the form $\ref{eqn_MoebiusRevealedForm}$. The fact that all maps of this form are indeed Möbius transformations can be seen either by direct calculation or by the observation that $\phi$ corresponds to map $P_S \circ \phi \circ P_S^{-1} = P_S \circ P_{TS}^{-1} \circ T$ from $S$ to itself which is a holomorphic automorphism and applying the theorem which states that the group of holomorphic automorphisms of the Riemann sphere is given exactly by all Möbius transformations.

First we consider the four basic types of transformaions and how they can be realized in the form (\ref{eqn_MoebiusRevealedForm}):
\begin{description}
\item[Translation:] The map $z \mapsto z + \alpha,\ \alpha \in \C$ can be realized by choosing an arbitrary admissible sphere $S$ and setting $T = T_{\alpha}: x \mapsto x + \iota(\alpha)$, which simply translates $S$ in a direction parallel to the $x_3 = 0$ plane by $\iota(\alpha)$.
\item[Dilation:] The map $z \mapsto \rho z,\ \rho \in \R$ can be obtained by choosing an arbitrary admissible sphere with north pole $n$ and setting $T = D_{\rho}: x \mapsto x + \left(0, 0, (\rho-1) n_3\right)$, which moves $S$ up- ($\rho > 1$)  or downwards ($\rho < 1$) in $x_3$ direction.
\item[Rotation:] The map $z \mapsto \epo{\ii \theta} z,\ \theta \in (-\pi, \pi]$ can be realized by choosing an admissible sphere with center $c = \left(0, 0, c_3\right)$ with arbitrary $c_3$ and setting 
\begin{equation*}
T = R_{\theta}: x \mapsto 
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos{\theta} & -\sin{\theta}            & 0\\
\sin{\theta} & \phantom{+}\cos{\theta}  & 0\\
0            & \phantom{+}0             & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation*}
which rotates $S$ around the $x_3$ axis by an angle of $\theta$.
\item[Inversion:] The map $z \mapsto \reci{z}$ can be realized by choosing $S$ as the unit sphere centered at the origin and setting
\begin{equation*}
T = V: x \mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \phantom{+}0 & \phantom{+}0 \\
0 & -1           & \phantom{+}0 \\
0 & \phantom{+}0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation*}
which is a rotation of $S$ around the $x_1$ axis by an angle of 180 degrees.
\end{description}
Now, let $\phi(z) = \moebius{a}{b}{c}{d}{z}$ be an arbitrary Möbius transformation. Following the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem_MoebiusGenerators}, we again distinguish the cases $c = 0$ and $c \ne 0$. If $c = 0$ we may assume without restriction that $d = 1$ and therefore $\phi(z) = az + b$. Clearly this map can be realized in the form (\ref{eqn_MoebiusRevealedForm}) by starting with an arbitrary admissible sphere $S$ and composing $T$ out of rotation by $\arg(a)$, dilation by $\abs{a}$ (in either order), followed by translation by $b$:
\begin{equation*}
T := T_b \circ D_{\abs{a}} \circ R_{\arg(a)}.
\end{equation*}
If $c \ne 0$, we can scale the coefficients such that $c = 1$ and write $\phi$ in the slightly more complicated form
\begin{equation*}
\phi(z) = a + \frac{b - ad}{z + d}.
\end{equation*}
In this case, we choose $S$ to be the sphere with unit radius centered at the point $\iota(-d)$ and we can again compose $T$ out of rigid motions to obtain a presentation of $\phi$ in the form (\ref{eqn_MoebiusRevealedForm}): First, translation by $d$ transforms $S$ to the unit sphere centered at the origin. Thus we can indeed apply the second transformation $V$ in order to perform an inversion. Finally we apply rotation and dilation by the factor $b - ad$ followed by a translation by $a$:
\begin{equation*}
T := T_a \circ D_{\abs{b - ad}} \circ R_{\arg(b - ad)} \circ V \circ T_d. \qedhere
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}
