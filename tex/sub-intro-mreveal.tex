\subsection{Stereographic projection}

This section is about the great work of Douglas Arnold and Jonathan Rogness, ``Möbius transformations revealed'' \cite{arnold2008mobius}, in which the authors give a characterization of Möbius transformations in terms of stereographic projections and rigid motions of spheres in 3D-space.

\index{Euclidean norm}
In order to introduce stereographic projection, we first have to embed $\C$ into $\R^3$. We do so by using the map 
\begin{equation}
\iota : \left\{\begin{array}{ccc}
\C & \to & \R^3 \\
z  & \mapsto & \left(\Re{z}, \Im{z}, 0\right)
\end{array}\right.,
\end{equation}
which means that we identify the complex plane with the plane $x_3 = 0$ in $\R^3$. Additionally we equip $\R^3$ with the standard Euclidean norm:
\begin{equation}
\eucnorm{x} := \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2}, \quad x \in \R^3.
\end{equation}

\begin{definition}[Admissible sphere]
\index{Admissible sphere}
A \emph{sphere} with center $c \in \R^3$ and radius $r > 0$ is the set $S := \setdef{x \in \R^3}{\eucnorm{x - c} = r}$. Its \emph{north-pole} is the unique point $n \in S$ with maximal $x_3$-coordinate. A sphere whose north pole lies in the upper half-space $H := \setdef{x \in \R^3}{x_3 > 0}$ is called an \emph{admissible sphere}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Stereographic projection]
\index{Stereographic projection}
\label{dfn_StereoProject}
Let $S$ be an admissible sphere and $n \in S$ be its north pole. If $x \in S \setminus \{n\}$, then denote by $L_{x,n}$ the unique line joining $x$ with $n$ and let $y$ be the intersection point of $L_{x,n}$ with the plane $\iota(\C)$. Now, \emph{stereographic projection} with regard to $S$ is the map $P_S : S \to \EC$ defined as $P_S(x) := \inv{\iota}(y)$ for $x \ne n$ and $P_S(n) := \infty$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
\label{rem_RiemannSphere}
\index{Riemann sphere}
Stereographic projection with regard to any admissible sphere $S \subseteq \R^3$ maps $S$ bijectively to $\EC$. Of course the most natural choice for $S$ in this context is the unit sphere $\UnitSphere := \setdef{x \in \R^3}{\eucnorm{x} = 1}$, having the advantage that stereographic projection follows the simple formula
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_StdStereoProj}
P_{\UnitSphere}:
\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{pmatrix} 
\mapsto \frac{x_1 + \\i x_2}{1 - x_3}.
\end{equation}
Also reverse stereographic projection can be done easily using the unit sphere:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_RevStdStereoProj}
P_{\UnitSphere}^{-1}: z \mapsto 
\reci{\abs{z}^2 + 1} 
\begin{pmatrix}2 \Re{z} \\ 2 \Im{z} \\ \abs{z}^2 - 1\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
By pointwise identifying $\EC$ with $S_1$ using the above two mappings, we obtain the $\emph{Riemann sphere}$ model of the extended complex plane. One of its benefits is that certain functions $\EC \to \EC$ can be interpreted nicely as simple rotations of the Riemann sphere.
\end{remark}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/stereo-proj-1}
\caption[Stereographic projection and the map $z \mapsto \reci{z}$]{Inversion $z \mapsto \reci{z}$ can be interpreted as rotation of the Riemann sphere by $180^{\circ}$ around the $x_1$ axis. It maps the upper to the lower half-plane (left) and the interior of the unit circle to its exterior (right).}
\label{fig_StereoProjInversion}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
\label{ex_StereoProjInversion}
Consider the map $f: z \mapsto \reci{z}$ and the map $V: \UnitSphere \to \UnitSphere$, which rotates the Riemann sphere around the $x_1$ axis by $180^{\circ}$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_RiemannX1Rotation}
V: x \mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \phantom{+}0 & \phantom{+}0 \\
0 & -1           & \phantom{+}0 \\
0 & \phantom{+}0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
The first row of Figure~\ref{fig_StereoProjInversion} shows the upper half-plane $U$ on the left and the unit disk $D$ on the right together with their images under reverse stereographic projection. We see that both, $U$ and $D$, correspond to a certain ``halfsphere'' of the Riemann sphere. If we rotate these halfspheres around the $x_1$ axis (leaving the points $\{\pm 1\}$ fixed) and continuously perform stereographic projection, we see that after a half turn (in the last row of Figure~\ref{fig_StereoProjInversion}) we end up with the lower half-plane $f(U)$ and the set of points $z$ with $\abs{z} > 1$, $f(D)$. 

It is worth noting that this correspondence between rotation of the Riemann sphere by $180^\circ$ and the map $f : z \mapsto \reci{z}$ does not just hold for the specially chosen sets $U$ and $D$, but indeed pointwise for every $z \in \EC$. In other words, we have
\begin{equation*}
f = P_{\UnitSphere} \circ V \circ P_{\UnitSphere}^{-1}.
\end{equation*}
We show this by a simple calculation, using the fact that $\reci{z} = \frac{\conj{z}}{\abs{z}^2}$ as well as (\ref{eqn_RevStdStereoProj}) and noting that for the case $z = \infty$ limits have to be introduced appropriately:
\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCcCl}
(P_{\UnitSphere}^{-1} \circ f)(z)
&=& \reci{\reci{\abs{z}^2} + 1} 
\begin{pmatrix}
  2 \Re{\reci{z}} \\ 2 \Im{\reci{z}} \\ \reci{\abs{z}^2} - 1
\end{pmatrix}
&=& \frac{\abs{z}^2}{1 + \abs{z}^2}
\begin{pmatrix}
  2 \reci{\abs{z}^2} \Re{\conj{z}} \\
  2 \reci{\abs{z}^2} \Im{\conj{z}} \\
  \frac{1 - \abs{z}^2}{\abs{z}^2}
\end{pmatrix} 
\\
&=&\reci{\abs{z}^2 + 1}
\begin{pmatrix}
  \phantom{+}2 \Re{z} \\ -2 \Im{z} \\ -\abs{z}^2 + 1
\end{pmatrix}
&=&
(V \circ P_{\UnitSphere}^{-1})(z).
\end{IEEEeqnarray*}
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
\label{rem_TRotation}
Other examples for transformations corresponding to a half-turn of the Riemann sphere are $z \mapsto -z$ (rotation around the $x_3$ axis) and $T: z \mapsto -\reci{z}$ (rotation around the $x_2$ axis; as product of half turns around the $x_1$ and $x_3$ axes). $T$ is a function which maps the upper half-plane to itself and which will be important in the study of the modular group in Section~\ref{sec_ModularGroupGenRel}.  
\end{remark}

\label{fig_StereoProjModCayley}

\index{Modified Cayley transform}
\index{Cayley transform}
In Figure~\ref{fig_StereoProjModCayley}, the action of yet another interesting transformation can be seen, which maps the upper half-plane to the unit disk. It is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_ModCayleyTransform}
\ModCayley(z) = \moebius{\ii}{1}{}{\ii}{z}
\end{equation}
and can be either considered as a quarter turn of the Riemann sphere around the $x_1$ axis or as ``half of an inversion'', since indeed $\ModCayley^2(z) = \ModCayley(\ModCayley(z)) = \reci{z}$ (compare with left column of Figure~\ref{fig_StereoProjInversion}). In contrast to its better known brother, the \emph{Cayley transform} given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_CayleyTransform}
\Cayley(z) = \frac{z - \ii}{z + \ii} = -\ii \ModCayley(z),
\end{equation}
$\ModCayley$ leaves the points $\{\pm 1\}$ fixed, which often beneficial for visualization purposes. We will call $\ModCayley$ the \emph{modified Cayley transform}. 
\end{example}
\begin{remark} 
Also the Cayley transform $\Cayley$ can be seen as rotation of the Riemann sphere by $120^\circ$ around the axis which is spanned by the vector $(1,-1,1) \in \R^3$. A figure illustrating this fact can be found for example in \Mumford{}, p.\ 88.
\end{remark}

We have now seen exemplary that quite a few interesting maps are induced by rotations of the Riemann sphere. If we are willing to allow not only rotations but also translations of the Riemann sphere, we indeed obtain a new characterization of Möbius transformations, as stated in the next theorem.

\begin{definition}
\index{Rigid motion}
A \emph{rigid motion} of $\R^3$ is an affine transformation of $\R^3$ which is obtained purely by composition of rotations and translations.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Möbius transformations revealed]
\label{thm_MoebiusRevealed}
A function $\phi : \EC \to \EC$ is a Möbius transformation, if and only if it can be obtained by reverse stereographic projection of $\EC$ to an admissible sphere $S \subseteq \R^3$, followed by a rigid motion T of $\R^3$ which maps $S$ to another admissible sphere $TS$, followed by stereographic projection from $TS$ back to $\EC$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_MoebiusRevealedForm}
\phi = P_{TS} \circ T \circ P_S^{-1}.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of proof]
The fact that all maps of form ($\ref{eqn_MoebiusRevealedForm}$) are indeed Möbius transformations can be seen either by direct calculation or by the observation that $\phi$ corresponds to the map $P_S^{-1} \circ \phi \circ P_S = P_S^{-1} \circ P_{TS} \circ T$ from $S$ to itself. If we identify $S$ with the Riemann sphere, we can regard $\phi$ as a holomorphic automorphism of the Riemann sphere which is therefore a Möbius transformation.

\todo{31}{Literature reference}

It remains to show that every given transformation can indeed be realized in the form (\ref{eqn_MoebiusRevealedForm}). For this purpose, we first consider the four basic types of Möbius transformations:
\begin{description}
\item[Translation:] The map $z \mapsto z + \alpha,\ \alpha \in \C$ can be realized by choosing an arbitrary admissible sphere $S$ and setting $T = T_{\alpha}: x \mapsto x + \iota(\alpha)$, which simply translates $S$ in a direction parallel to the $x_3 = 0$ plane by $\iota(\alpha)$.
\item[Dilation:] The map $z \mapsto \rho z,\ \rho > 0$ can be obtained by choosing an arbitrary admissible sphere with north pole $n$ and setting $T = D_{\rho}: x \mapsto x + \left(0, 0, (\rho-1) n_3\right)$, which moves $S$ up- ($\rho > 1$)  or downwards ($\rho < 1$) in $x_3$ direction.
\item[Rotation:] The map $z \mapsto \epo{\ii \theta} z,\ \theta \in (-\pi, \pi]$ can be realized by choosing an arbitrary admissible sphere and setting 
\begin{equation*}
T = R_{\theta}: x \mapsto 
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos{\theta} & -\sin{\theta}            & 0\\
\sin{\theta} & \phantom{+}\cos{\theta}  & 0\\
0            & \phantom{+}0             & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation*}
which rotates $S$ around the $x_3$ axis by an angle of $\theta$.
\item[Inversion:] We have seen in Example~\ref{ex_StereoProjInversion} that the map $z \mapsto \reci{z}$ can be realized by choosing $S$ as the unit sphere $\UnitSphere$ and setting $T = V$ -- as defined in (\ref{eqn_RiemannX1Rotation}) -- which is a rotation of $\UnitSphere$ around the $x_1$ axis by an angle of $180^{\circ}$.
\end{description}
Now let $\phi(z) = \moebius{a}{b}{c}{d}{z}$ be an arbitrary Möbius transformation. As in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem_MoebiusGenerators}, if $c = 0$ we may assume without restriction that $d = 1$ and therefore $\phi(z) = az + b$. Clearly this map can be realized in the form (\ref{eqn_MoebiusRevealedForm}) by starting with an arbitrary admissible sphere $S$ and taking $T$ as the composition of rotation by $\arg(a)$, dilation by $\abs{a}$ (in either order), followed by translation by $b$:
\begin{equation*}
T := T_b \circ D_{\abs{a}} \circ R_{\arg(a)}.
\end{equation*}
If $c \ne 0$, we can scale the coefficients $a,b,c,d$ such that $c = 1$ and write $\phi$ in the form
\begin{equation*}
\phi(z) = a + \frac{b - ad}{z + d}.
\end{equation*}
Now we choose $S$ to be the sphere with unit radius centered at the point $\iota(-d)$ and we compose $T$ out of the following rigid motions: First, translation by $d$ transforms $S$ to the unit sphere $\UnitSphere$. Thus we can indeed apply $V$ as the second transformation in order to perform an inversion. Finally we apply rotation and dilation by the factor $b - ad$ followed by a translation by $a$:
\begin{equation*}
T := T_a \circ D_{\abs{b - ad}} \circ R_{\arg(b - ad)} \circ V \circ T_d. \qedhere
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}
